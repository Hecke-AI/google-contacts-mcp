# Introduction: Why Build an MCP Server?

## The Problem

After 30 years of professional work spanning cyber defense, nuclear security, teaching, and consulting, my Google Contacts had become a digital junk drawer. I had:

- **750 contacts** accumulated over two decades
- **Iraq deployment contacts** from 2005-2011 that were long obsolete
- **Service vendors** I'd never use again (taxi services from cities I visited once)
- **Duplicate entries** with inconsistent formatting
- **Missing data** - contacts with no email or phone
- **Mixed contexts** - personal, professional, and everything in between

Traditional contact management tools made cleanup tedious:
- Manual review, one at a time
- No bulk operations
- No intelligent categorization
- Hours of repetitive clicking

## The Solution

What if I could use Claude to help me:
1. **Categorize** contacts intelligently
2. **Identify** obsolete entries automatically
3. **Delete** in bulk
4. **Clean** data quality issues
5. **Review** efficiently

That required Claude to interact with Google Contacts - which meant building an **MCP server**.

## What is MCP?

The **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is a standard way for AI assistants like Claude to interact with external tools and data sources. Think of it as a universal adapter that lets Claude:

- Read and write to databases
- Call external APIs
- Access local files
- Integrate with SaaS platforms
- And much more

### MCP Architecture (Simple View)

```
┌─────────┐         ┌────────────┐         ┌──────────────┐
│ Claude  │ ◄─MCP─► │ MCP Server │ ◄─API─► │ Google       │
│ Code    │         │ (This!)    │         │ Contacts     │
└─────────┘         └────────────┘         └──────────────┘
```

The MCP server acts as a **translator** between Claude's requests and Google's API.

## What You'll Learn

By studying and using this MCP server, you'll understand:

### 1. MCP Fundamentals
- How to define tools that Claude can use
- Request/response patterns
- Error handling in MCP context

### 2. OAuth 2.0 Authentication
- Setting up Google Cloud credentials
- Implementing OAuth flow
- Managing tokens securely

### 3. Google People API Integration
- CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Working with contact resources
- Pagination and search

### 4. TypeScript & Node.js
- Building type-safe servers
- Async/await patterns
- File system operations for token storage

### 5. Real-World Problem Solving
- Bulk operations
- Data quality cleanup
- Categorization strategies

## Why This Matters

MCP servers unlock **AI-native workflows**. Instead of:
- Switching between apps
- Manual data entry
- Repetitive clicking
- Context switching

You can:
- Ask Claude to do it
- Automate bulk operations
- Maintain context across tasks
- Work conversationally

## The Result

Using this MCP server, I:
- **Categorized** 750 contacts into 8 organized groups in minutes
- **Deleted** 446 obsolete contacts with 100% accuracy
- **Cleaned** 18 data quality issues
- **Reviewed** remaining contacts efficiently in Excel
- **Reduced** my contact database by 60%

**Total time:** A few hours vs. what would have been days of manual work.
